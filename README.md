## How to Play
1. Players take turns placing black and white stones on the board.
2. The goal is to form an unbroken line of five stones (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally).
3. Black plays first but must follow Renju's advanced rules to prevent unfair advantages.
4. The game continues until a player wins or the board is full.
